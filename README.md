A simple chess AI that has a rating of approximatly 1000 ELO on sites like Chess.com or Lichess. 
In the SmarMoveFinder, you will find a depth option. The AI will work best on 4, meaning a good compromise between waiting time and good counterplay. 

Further comments are in the code. Everything is written in Python. It is important to make sure you have the modules needed at the start of the code. 
See the imports. 

Images and sounds are added recently, these are home-made and can be used without the need of any permission. 
Images are in CSV format to safe as much space as possible while retaining superior flexibility in resolution. 

Keep in mind that for every audio file, you HAVE to change the directory in which the file is housed. Do not forget to use // instead of /!
For any questions, do not hesitate to send a message. 

Good luck,
